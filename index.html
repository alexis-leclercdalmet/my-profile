				<h2>#1 A young journalist</h2>
				<p>
					My path in the youth press began in high school when I joined the school newspaper: <b>Le Charcotidien</b>. Then I went through <a href="https://lamouettebblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">La Mouette Bâillonnée</a>, newspaper of the Marcelin Berthelot high school (94). At that time, I crossed the path of the national association of promotion and defence of the press of young initiative: <a href="https://www.jetsdencre.asso.fr/" target="_blank">Jets d'encre</a>. If I am still a member of the association, I have been an administrator for 2 years. Outcome of the meeting with the members of the association, I founded the young associative webjournal <a href="https://hexagonlineblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hexag'Online</a>, of which I was editor in chief! <b>In short, a decade of commitment to the freedom of expression of young people.</b>

				<h2>#2 A queer activist</h2>
				<p>
					I have been fighting every day since high school for the rights of LGBTQ+ people. I dream of a world in which heteropatriarchy, as it has been understood by the humanities and social sciences, is no more. I was a member of the <a href="https://www.ajlgbt.info/" target="_blank">French association of LGBTQI+ journalists</a> and have just joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/assaslgbt/?hc_location=ufi" target="_blank">Assas LGBT+</a>. If I am already involved in protests, in the accompaniment of the concerned people and in the pedagogy with the non-concerned ones, <b>I wish to continue this commitment through lobbying and politics.</b>
				</p>

				<h2>#3 An aspiring politician</h2>
				<p>
					When I was only 10 years old, I was already a municipal councillor for children and young people in my town, Joinville-le-Pont (94). In high school, I joined the student life council and was the founding president of the "Maison des Lycéens", an association run by students for students. When I finally arrived at the university, I was vice-president and founder of the association  of my degree, degree representative and elected to the council of the French Press Institute. Today, I am elected to the academic council of the University of Paris II Panthéon-Assas for Assas In Progress, a federation of 7 associations committed to more humanism, solidarity and social justice at the university. <b>I believe that the values I defend on a daily basis must be carried into the decision-making spheres of our societies, and that this happens through a political commitment. </b>
